PCB Design of GPS Data Logger Using ATmega328P Microcontroller 

This project involved the design of a GPS data logger based on the ATmega328P microcontroller. The goal was to accurately capture and store GPS data, with the ATmega328P chosen for its simplicity and reliability. Power regulation was achieved using an LM7805 voltage regulator to ensure stable voltage for sensitive components. The design was executed using Altium Designer, focusing on precise component placement and optimal routing for enhanced system stability and reliability.
